# Binary Variables #
Binary random variables have two outcomes. Either the outcome is 1 or 0. We often use different labels for the outcomes, such as *yes* and *no*, *heart attack*, *no heart attack* and so on.

We are interested in the probability of the positive outcome (or the proportion or percentage).   

The probability of a positive outcome will be denoted by {$$} \pi {/$$}.  Let Y be binary random variable. Then we write {$$} P[Y=1]=\pi {/$$} for the probability of Y taking the value 1. 

This is also the expected value of Y. We can say (informally) that on average we see
1 and 0 with the proportions  {$$} \pi {/$$} and {$$} 1-\pi {/$$} of the time.  There fore the expected value is

{$$}
\pi = 1 \times \pi+0 \times (1-\pi).
{/$$} 

In mathematical notation we write {$$} E[Y]=\pi {/$$}.
