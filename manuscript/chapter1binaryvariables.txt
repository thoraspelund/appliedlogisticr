# Binary Variables 

Binary random variables have two outcomes. Either the outcome is 1 or 0. We often use different labels for the outcomes, such as yes and not, and heart attack and no heart attack and so on.

We are interested in the probability of the positive outcome (or the proportion or percentage).

The probability of a positive outcome will be denoted by π.

Let Y be binary random variable. Then we write P[Y=1]= π for the probability of Y taking the value 1.

The equation is
